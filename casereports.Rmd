```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(googleVis)
states <- read.csv("./state_level_latest.csv", header = T)[1:6]
states <- states[-1, ]
```

## Application Overview

- This application will enable you to check the number of cases across India statewise.
- The values are updated daily.
- You can select the type of cases you wish to check from the dropdown menu.
- The output is an interacticve map of India with distinct colored states corresponding to the number of cases.


## Dataset

The dataset used is extracted from a [github repository](https://github.com/imdevskp/covid-19-india-data). The data consists of a variety of fields but we only need the first 6 for our application. 

```{r data, echo=TRUE}
str(states)
```

## Plot

`googleVis` library has been used in this application. This library provides a lot of features to interact with our map and it is perfect for our application. 

```{r plot, echo=T}
g <- gvisGeoChart(data, "State", "Confirmed", 
                  options=list(region="IN", displayMode="regions", 
                              resolution="provinces"))
```
